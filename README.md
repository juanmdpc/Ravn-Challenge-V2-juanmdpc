## Tech Stack
* Kotlin + Data Binding + ViewModel + LiveData + Kotllin Coroutines
* Android architecture components
* Dagger Hilt for Dependency Injection
* Apollo-android for Graphql queries

## Architecture
* Follows the MVVM architecture.


#### Asumptions
1. *Because is a challengue, details-fragment do query data also, for practice ApolloClient.*
2. *Is my first time with ApolloClient, Kotlin Coroutines, LiveData, Dagger Hilt and MVVM Architecture.*
